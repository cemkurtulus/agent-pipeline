# Global Agent Pipeline Rules

## MCP Tool Usage

This project uses the **Agent Pipeline** MCP server. The following tools are available:

- `pipeline_get_task` - Get the current task description and pipeline status
- `pipeline_get_outputs` - Get outputs from previous agents (optional: filter by agent_name)
- `pipeline_save_output` - Save your output when you complete your work (required: agent_name, output)
- `pipeline_get_context` - Get project file structure and tech stack
- `pipeline_get_status` - Get full pipeline status with history

## Workflow

When working as part of the agent pipeline:

1. **First**, call `pipeline_get_task` to understand the current task
2. **Then**, call `pipeline_get_outputs` to see what previous agents have produced
3. **Do your work** according to your agent role
4. **Finally**, call `pipeline_save_output` with your agent name and output

## Code Standards

- Write clean, readable, well-documented code
- Follow the existing project conventions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Consider edge cases
- Write in the language/framework the project uses
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
